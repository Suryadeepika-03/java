The Electricity Bill Generator project aims to develop a simple utility for calculating electricity bills based on the units consumed by the user. This project provides a straightforward solution for individuals or small businesses to generate accurate electricity bills without the need for complex billing systems. The application prompts the user to input the number of units consumed, calculates the total bill amount using a fixed rate per unit, and displays a summary of the bill. The report outlines the objectives, features, implementation details, and includes a sample code snippet for reference.
